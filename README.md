1) Load the csv file
2) From the first two timestamps (cells A4 and A5), find out reporting frequency (in this case, it is 10s). Simply subtract cell A5 from A4 to get the duration and report the value
3) Create a new CSV file containing the following:
    - Column A - report the timestamp
    - Column B and C - report the average value for every 5 minutes. 
For example, row 4 should have the average value of all numbers in a column between timestamps 01/12/2019 23:00:00 and 01/12/2019 23:05:00. Similarly, Row 5 should contain the average value of all numbers in a column between  timestamps 01/12/2019 23:00:10 and 01/12/2019 23:05:10.
